    <h2>Penn State vs Iowa, the chances, what people are thinking, and the pregame</h2>
    <p><em>Published: October 15, 2025</em></p>
    <p>As all Nittany Lion fans know, PSU will be playing Iowa on the 18th of October, 2025, at 7:00 PM EST. Here's what all Nittany Lion and Iowa fans need to know before coming into the game. </p>
    <p>The chances are barely in Penn State's favor as of Wednesday afternoon, with a +3 head on betting markets. This will be a tight game, and we all know it. </p>
    <p>The game is an away game for the Nittany Lions, and will be played in Kinnick Stadium. As we all know, PSU has been in quite a slump recently, with Coach Franklin being fired and Drew injured. Because of Allar's season ending injury, this will be the first game of the season that Ethan Grunkemeyer will be playing in as QB. Tons of fans have been thinking the same, and that is "Is this guy good?", and boy, yes he is. Although not Allar level, he will definitely carry through for PSU. Compared to Iowa's Mark, they will be about equal in this game. </p>
